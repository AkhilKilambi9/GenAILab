SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT_1=Summarize the text: A balanced diet and regular exercise are cornerstones of a healthy lifestyle. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins provides essential nutrients that support the immune system, promote healthy skin, and improve energy levels. Regular exercise complements a balanced diet by boosting cardiovascular health, enhancing muscle strength, and improving mental well-being through the release of endorphins. Together, these habits reduce the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Ultimately, a combination of nutritious food and physical activity is vital for maintaining a healthy weight and achieving overall wellness.
SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT_2=Summarize the main points of the text in two sentences, focusing on the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem health: Biodiversity is crucial for maintaining the stability and resilience of ecosystems. Diverse ecosystems are better equipped to withstand environmental changes and disruptions, as a variety of species contribute to the balance of food chains and nutrient cycles. For example, plants and trees support pollinators, which in turn help produce crops that humans rely on. The loss of biodiversity weakens ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to threats like climate change and pollution. Protecting biodiversity is essential for preserving the natural resources, clean air, and water that all species, including humans, depend on for survival.
SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT_3=Provide a summary that explains the primary causes and lasting impacts of World War I, written in a neutral and factual tone: World War I, often called The Great War, was triggered by a complex web of alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 sparked a chain reaction among European powers, leading to a devastating global conflict. With trench warfare and new technologies like machine guns and chemical weapons, the war saw unprecedented casualties and destruction. The Treaty of Versailles formally ended the war in 1919 but imposed heavy reparations on Germany, contributing to economic hardship and political instability. These tensions eventually laid the groundwork for World War II, highlighting the lasting consequences of the conflict.
SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT_4=Summarize the key advancements in artificial intelligence and discuss their potential impact on future employment. Keep the tone professional and concise, and limit the summary to three sentences: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming industries worldwide, impacting the job market in profound ways. Machine learning, natural language processing, and automation are enabling businesses to optimize processes, enhance customer experiences, and drive innovation. However, as AI systems take over repetitive tasks, concerns about job displacement arise, particularly in manufacturing, retail, and customer service sectors. On the other hand, AI also creates new opportunities in tech development, data analysis, and ethical AI governance. While some jobs may be lost to automation, others will evolve or emerge, emphasizing the need for skill adaptation in the workforce.
SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT_5=Write a summary of this passage that captures the characters emotional journey and growth, using descriptive language to reflect the tone of the original text. Write about 200 words: As she journeyed through the mist-covered forest, Elara felt a quiet strength growing within her. The weight of past sorrows and uncertainties began to lift as each step took her deeper into the heart of nature. She recalled her struggles, the heartbreak and fear that once held her captive, yet here, among towering trees and the whisper of leaves, she found peace. Her spirit, once fractured, now felt whole, mended by the resilience shed discovered within herself. Elaras journey was not just a path through the forest but a journey to self-acceptance, marking the beginning of her transformation.
COT_PROMPT_1=A farmer owns a triangular piece of land with vertices at points A(0,0), B(0,100), and ùê∂(100,0). The farmer plans to divide this triangular land into smaller triangular plots for different crops. The plot is divided into 10 plots. Planting Schedule and Crop Rotation: If the farmer rotates 5 different crop types every 2 months, how many different planting combinations can he have over a 12-month period? Assume he can plant only one type of crop per plot at a time. I have a similar question I will give it to you as input and its solution, use that logic. A theater company has a stage with a triangular performance area defined by vertices at points A(0,0), B(0,100), and C(100,0). The company plans to divide this stage into 10 smaller triangular sections for different performances. Each section will be used for various play types. If the theater company rotates through 4 different play genres every 3 months, how many different performance combinations can the company have over a 12-month period? Assume that only one type of play can be performed in each section at any given time. This is a similar question, let me give you its solution. Solution of theatre question is: To determine the number of different performance combinations the theater company can have over a 12-month period, lets break down the problem step by step. Stage Division: The stage is divided into 10 sections. Play Genres: There are 4 different play genres. Rotation Period: The genres are rotated every 3 months. Total Time Frame: 12 months. Number of Periods: 12/3 = 4 periods. Constraint: Only one type of play can be performed in each section at any given time. The same play genre cannot be performed in the same section in consecutive periods. This is implied by the rotation of genres every 3 months. Calculations for One Section: First Period (Months 1-3): The company can choose any of the 4 play genres. Number of choices: 4. Subsequent Periods (Periods 2 to 4): In each new period, the company cannot perform the same genre as in the immediate previous period in the same section. Therefore, there are 3 choices (all genres except the one just performed). Number of choices per period: 3. Total Number of Sequences for One Section: Total combinations per section: Number of choices= 4 * 3^3. 4 choices for the first period. 3 choices for each of the next 3 periods. Calculating 3^3=27. Total combinations per section: 4√ó27=108. Calculations for All 10 Sections: 108^10. Final Answer: The theater company can have 108^10 different performance combinations over a 12-month period across all 10 sections. Above is the solution, make sure to remember In each new period, the company cannot perform the same genre as in the immediate previous period in the same section. Solve the first question based on this sample solution.
